# The budget

The production host has **1.9 GB of RAM and 1.9 GB of swap**. Container limits once summed to
~8.7 GB and the machine ran with 948 MB of swap in use. They were rewritten to ~2.4 GB total on
2026-03-27. Each limit comes from measured actual usage plus headroom [^commit-2b86d70]. The
limits are backend 128M (16 MB actual), worker 128M (19 MB) and Qdrant 128M (9 MB). Postgres is
192M with `shared_buffers` cut 256→64 MB, Redpanda 384M with its memory flag at 256M and `smp 1`,
and Tika 192M (73 MB).

Two server-level settings belong to the same decision: `vm.swappiness=10` and
`vm.overcommit_memory=0`.

# The rule this leaves

Memory is not the only exhaustible resource on this host. The disk filled too, and the pruning
that was supposed to prevent it had never deleted anything — see [the disk-full
outage](../defects/the-disk-full-outage.md).

**A new limit is derived from a measurement on this host, not from a default**. The service
defaults are all one to two orders of magnitude above what these workloads use. The sum, not any
single limit, is what breaks. Adding a service means re-checking the total against 1.9 GB.

This is also the constraint that eventually removed the observability stack from production — see
[Observability was deprecated in production](../decisions/observability-was-deprecated-in-production.md).
Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, OTEL, Promtail and cAdvisor accounted for roughly 1.1 GB of the
2.4 GB after right-sizing.

[^commit-2b86d70]: commit `2b86d70`, `fix: right-size container memory limits for 1.9GB server`.
