    title: "The four commits that put observability behind a compose profile"

# What changed

Over 2026-06-12 the observability services were put behind a compose `profiles: ["observability"]`
gate, dropped from the deploy path. Trace export was switched off because the collector was gone
[^observability-teardown]. The driver was the same one behind [Container limits are sized to
a 1.9 GB server](../constraints/container-limits-fit-a-1-9gb-server.md). Prometheus, Grafana,
Loki, Jaeger, OTEL, Promtail and cAdvisor together are most of a budget the host does not have.

# The consequence that outlived the change

For two months `README.md` and `docs/observability.md` went on documenting live production Grafana,
Prometheus and Jaeger endpoints. Someone debugging a production incident would have followed them,
found nothing, and not known whether the stack was down or was never there.

Both now say the stack is profile-gated and not deployed, and the four production URLs are gone.
The runbook itself was kept, not deleted. The dashboards, alert rules and compose services all
still exist and still run under `--profile observability`, so the content was accurate. Only its
claim about where it was reachable was not.

This is also why `slog` output is not a substitute for a stored receipt — see
[Candidate evaluation](../computations/candidate-evaluation.md). The reasoning that made logs
sufficient assumed a collector that is no longer deployed.

[^observability-teardown]: commits `0f826d2`, `87520ff`, `88bfaa5`, `f6b0502`, all 2026-06-12.
